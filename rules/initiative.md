# Initiative

Combat flows in **Rounds**. In each Round, characters act in descending order of **Tier**.

## Tier Phases

Resolve all turns for the highest Tier present before proceeding to the next highest Tier.

**Example**: If a battle involves Tier 2 and Tier 1 characters, all Tier 2 characters complete their turns before any Tier 1 character acts.

## Turn Order Within a Tier

If multiple sides have characters in the active Tier, they alternate activations ("I Go, You Go").

1. **Determine Priority**: Establish the order in which sides act (see below).
2. **Alternating Activations**: The first side activates one character, then the next side activates one character. Cycle through all sides in Priority order.
3. **Repeat**: Continue cycling until all characters in the active Tier have taken a turn.
4. **Uneven Numbers**: If a side has no characters left to activate in the current Tier, skip them in the cycle.

### Determining Priority

To determine the order of sides for a Tier:

1. **Speed Advantage**: Count the total number of **Skirmishers** and **Tacticians** in the active Tier on each side. The side with the highest count goes first.
2. **The Draw**: If counts are tied, one representative from each tied side draws a card. Compare values. The side with the higher card goes first. Repeat draws until the order is established.

## Character Selection

When it is a side's turn to act, the players on that side choose which specific character activates. Any character in the active Tier who has not yet acted this Round may be chosen.

## New Round

When all characters of all Tiers have acted, the Round ends. Begin a new Round starting again with the highest Tier.
