# Positioning

## Movement Terms

- **Move**: Change position up to the specified distance.
- **Advance**: Move in a straight line toward the target. The line must be drawn so that if you continued the full distance, you would end B2B with the target. You may stop at any point along this line before reaching B2B.
- **Retreat**: Move in a straight line directly away from the target.
- **Place**: Position the character or object at a specific location (ignores intervening terrain).

## Terrain

**Rough Terrain**: While a model's base is touching a section of rough terrain, each inch of movement through that terrain costs 2" of the model's movement.

### Advance Example

You are 4" away from an enemy. You Advance 3" toward them. You draw a straight line from the center of your base in any direction. If continuing along that line would eventually result in B2B contact with the target, the Advance is valid. You move 3" along this line. This means you could move directly at the target's center, or at an angle that would clip their base if you continued far enough.

### Retreat Example

You are B2B with an enemy. You Retreat 3" away from them. You draw a straight line from the center of your base away from the nearest point of the enemy's base, and move 3" along that line.

## Forced Movement

Push, Pull, and Reposition are forced movement. All forced movement is subject to **Size & Tier Resistance**.

### Size & Tier Resistance

The distance is reduced by 1" for each size category the target is larger than the acting character. The distance is also reduced by 1" for each Tier the target is higher than the acting character. Size and Tier reductions are cumulative. If the final distance is 0" or less, the forced movement fails and the target does not move.

When forced movement affects multiple targets, the acting character chooses the order targets are moved. Forced movement stops if the target contacts another character or terrain.

### Forced Movement Types

- **Push**: Force a character or terrain to move directly away in a straight line. Subject to Size & Tier Resistance.
- **Pull**: Force a character or terrain to move directly toward in a straight line. Subject to Size & Tier Resistance.
- **Reposition**: Force a character or terrain to move in any direction. Subject to Size & Tier Resistance.

### Reposition Example

A Tier 2, Size 1 character uses Reposition (2" base distance) on a Tier 3, Size 2 enemy. The target is 1 size larger (-1") and 1 Tier higher (-1"), reducing the distance to 0". The Reposition fails and the target does not move.

## Measurement Terms

- **Inches (")**: Standard distance measurement.
- **Range 0**: Target must be B2B (base-to-base, models touching).
- **B2B**: Base-to-base, models are touching. Characters of Size 2+ are considered B2B with anything within 1".
- **Engaged**: B2B with an enemy.
- **Range X**: Measure from base to target's base (or nearest point for terrain).
- **Within X"**: Any point within the specified distance.
- **LoS**: Unobstructed straight line from base to target.

## Line of Sight & Cover

- **Cover**: A character cannot claim Cover from an object smaller than their own Size category.

## Movement Restrictions

- **Blocking**: You cannot move through an enemy's space unless they are at least **2 Sizes larger** or **2 Sizes smaller** than you.
