## Open Questions

- **Armor Penalties**: Need to define penalties for different armor types (Light/Medium/Heavy) of the same Tier to balance the Defense gains (e.g., speed reduction, stealth penalty, essence cost increase).
- **Tier Scaling**: All current equipment is Tier 1. Need to define how stats/bonuses scale at higher Tiers.
