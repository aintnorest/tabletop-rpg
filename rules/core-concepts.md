# Core Concepts

## Design Philosophy

### Fast Play, Deep Planning
- **Session Flow**: Streamlined resolution for quick combat and skills.
- **Character Building**: Complex, rewarding choices for between-session engagement.

### Flexible Character Creation
- **Concept First**: Mechanics support character concepts, not define them.
- **No Class Restrictions**: Abilities can be mixed and matched.
- **Diverse Sources**: Magic, martial, psionics, and tech are equally supported.

### Mechanical Foundation
- **Consistency**: Reliable rules allow for strategy.
- **Balance**: No single build dominates.
- **Structure**: Rules provide tactical depth, not narrative improv.

### Power Progression
- **Growth**: Clear power increases via skills, abilities, stats, and gear.
- **Milestones**: Satisfying advancement moments.
- **Planning**: Long-term build strategies are rewarded.

### Tactical Depth
- **Positioning**: Terrain, range, and movement are decisive.
- **Scale**: Creature sizes (25mm to 60mm) have mechanical impact.
- **Strategy**: Planning and coordination outweigh luck.

### GM Ease
- **Prep**: Session setup is quick and modular.
- **Tools**: Mechanics support rapid encounter generation.

## Core Mechanical Decisions

### Action Economy
- Multiple action expenditures per turn.

### Positioning
- Forced movement and battlefield control are core mechanics.

### Conditions
- All conditions provide negative effects.

### Reactions
- Reactions cost Action tokens.

## Core Tension
**Goal**: Limitless character flexibility within a balanced framework.

**Constraints**:
- No build is objectively superior.
- System remains teachable.
- Sessions maintain pace.
- All players remain effective.

## Rules for Writing Game Documents

1. **Discuss first, write after**: Document decisions, not brainstorming.
2. **Rules only, no justification**: State what IS.
3. **No meta-commentary**: Omit design notes and comparisons.
4. **One clear example**: Provide one example per concept if needed.
5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Define once, clearly.
6. **Decided rules only**: Document final decisions.
7. **Open questions go last**: Keep undecided items at the bottom.

**Test**: Would this go in a published rulebook? If no, cut it.
