# Character Creation

This guide outlines the process for creating a Tier 1 character.

## Character Sheet Format

Use a standard 4x6 index card for your character sheet, At most a single page of paper for everything you need.

- **Universal Actions** (Move, Attack, Defend, etc.) are available to everyone via the shared table reference. Do not record these on your card.
- **Prepared Actions** are the specific Archetype or Custom actions you have memorized for battle. Only these appear on your character card.

---

## Step 1: Base Stats

Record the standard Tier 1 stats (see `stats.md`).

| Stat | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vitality** | **14** | 10 Base + 4 (Tier 1). |
| **Defense** | **5** | Base value. Will increase with Armor. |
| **Essence** | **5** | Base value. |
| **Action Tokens** | **3** | Standard for Tier 1. |
| **Condition Limit** | **5** | Max stacks per condition type (see `conditions.md`). |

## Step 2: Concept & Identity

### 1. Concept
Describe your character in one sentence. This is your core concept.

### 2. Identities
Choose **2 Identities** (see `identity.md`).

### 3. Starting Wealth
Determine your starting resources based on your Identity (see `equipment.md`).

---

## Step 3: Archetype & Actions

### 1. Choose an Archetype
Select one Archetype (see `archetype.md`).

### 2. Record Tier 1 Benefit
Write down the passive benefit granted by your Archetype.
*   **Update Stats**: If your Archetype grants a bonus to Vitality or Essence, update your Base Stats now.

### 3. Select Prepared Actions (The Loadout)
Your Archetype grants you access to several unique actions.
- **Choose 3 Actions** from your Archetype's Tier 1 list to be your **Prepared Actions**.
- Write these 3 actions on your character card.

---

## Step 4: The Path (Tier 1)

At Tier 1, your Path is **Unformed**.

### The Temporary Path
Draft a **Temporary Path Statement** (see `magic-system.md`). This represents the goal you are striving toward.

---

## Step 5: Equipment

Spend your starting Spirit Chips to purchase gear (see `equipment.md`).

### Update Stats
- Add your Armor bonus to your Base Defense. Round down to the nearest whole number.
- Note any Weapon augmentations on your Prepared Actions.

## Final Review

Your Character Card should contain:
1.  **Name & Concept**
2.  **Identities** (x2)
3.  **Stats**: Vit, Def, Ess, Tokens
4.  **Tier 1 Benefit**
5.  **Prepared Actions** (x3)
6.  **Weapon & Armor** (Passive bonuses already calculated into stats/actions)

You are now ready to play.
