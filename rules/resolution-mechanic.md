# Resolution Mechanic

## When to Resolve

Only use the resolution system when there is **tension** (meaningful stakes/consequences) **AND** the outcome is uncertain based on the character's competence.

### Competence Matrix

| Task Type | No Applicable Knowledge | Applicable Knowledge |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mundane** | **Draw Cards** | **Auto-Success** |
| **Specialized** | **Auto-Failure** | **Draw Cards** |

*   **Mundane Task**: An average person could accomplish this.
*   **Specialized Task**: Requires specific training or Identity.

**Note**: Even if a roll is called for, if there are no stakes (no time pressure, no risk), the character eventually succeeds without a draw if there is any seeming way they could succeed.

## The Deck

Each player has a base 16-card deck (one of each suit: ♠ ♥ ♦ ♣). Composition depends on your Tier:

| Tier | Card Ranks |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1** | A, 2, 3, 4 |
| **2** | 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| **3** | 4, 5, 6, 7 |
| **4** | 6, 7, 8, 9 |
| **5** | 8, 9, 10, J |
| **6** | 10, J, Q, K |

### Card Values
*   **Ace**: 1
*   **2-10**: Face Value
*   **Jack (J)**: 11
*   **Queen (Q)**: 12
*   **King (K)**: 13

### Drawing & Shuffling
*   **On Your Turn**: Draw 2 cards, sum their values.
*   **Off Turn**: Draw 0 cards (unless a specific ability allows 1).
*   **Discard**: Played cards go to a face-down discard pile.
*   **Reshuffle**: When you need to draw a card and your deck has 0 cards remaining, immediately shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck, then continue drawing. If you need to draw multiple cards and run out mid-draw, shuffle and continue.

## Path Suit Interaction
*   **Effect**: Gain 1 Essence if you draw a card matching your Path's suit.

## Non-Combat Resolution

When performing non-combat tasks (exploring, socializing, investigating), use the following modifiers and target numbers.

### Physical Competence by Tier

At higher Tiers, characters' bodies are reinforced by fundamental truths. Mundane physical tasks (climbing, lifting, running, jumping) that would challenge a Tier 1 character become trivial for higher Tiers. Use the Competence Matrix to determine if a Draw is needed—if a task is mundane and the character has applicable knowledge (physical capability from their Tier), it is an automatic success.

### Core Calculation
**Result** = (Draw 2 Cards) + (Modifiers) vs. **Target Number**

### Modifiers (Sources)
Calculate your modifier based on the **Sources** (Identities, Paths, Fragments) you use to justify the action.

*   **Base Modifier**: Add the **Tier** of your highest relevant Source.
*   **Synergy**: Add **+1** for each additional relevant Source (up to a maximum bonus equal to your Character Tier).
*   **Pressure**: Apply **-2 to -5** for actions under duress or time constraints.

### Target Numbers (TN)

| Difficulty | TN |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | 5 |
| **Tier 2** | 7 |
| **Tier 3** | 11 |
| **Tier 4** | 17 |
| **Tier 5** | 21 |
| **Tier 6** | 26 |

### Resolution Flow
1.  **Check Stakes & Competence**: Determine if a draw is needed.
2.  **Determine TN**: GM sets Target Number based on difficulty tier.
3.  **Draw**: Draw 2 cards and sum their values.
4.  **Calculate Modifiers**:
    *   Identify relevant Sources.
    *   Base = Highest Source Tier.
    *   Synergy = +1 per extra source (max = Character Tier).
    *   Subtract Pressure penalties.
5.  **Result**: Compare (Draw + Modifiers) vs TN.

## Assistance (Teamwork)

There are two types of assistance, depending on the nature of the task:

### Type 1: Physical Assist
When multiple people can contribute direct physical effort (pushing a boulder, lifting a beam, holding a door):

1.  **Declare Assistance**: Allies describe how they are helping.
2.  **GM Determines Cap**: GM decides how many people can physically help based on the situation.
3.  **Bonus**: Add **+1 per helper** to the final result.

*No additional card draws needed—everyone's effort stacks directly.*

### Type 2: Idea/Input Assist
When the task involves perception, planning, problem-solving, or decision-making where different input doesn't guarantee good input:

1.  **Declare Assistance**: Allies describe their ideas or observations.
2.  **The Draw**:
    *   **Acting Character**: Draws 2 cards.
    *   **Helpers**: Each helper draws 1 card and reveals it.
3.  **The Bonus**:
    *   Compare each helper card to the acting character's **lowest** card:
        *   **Higher** than the lowest card: **+1**
        *   **Lower** than the lowest card: **-1**
        *   **Equal** to the lowest card: **+0**
    *   Sum all the bonuses and penalties for the final modifier (can be negative).

*More helpers create bigger swings—great ideas stack up, but bad input actively hurts. The collective wisdom (or chaos) of the group determines the outcome.*
