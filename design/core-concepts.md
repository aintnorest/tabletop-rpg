# Core Concepts

## Genre & Inspiration
**Tactical Cultivation Fantasy**: A TTRPG inspired by progression fantasy and cultivation novels (e.g., *Defiance of the Fall*, *Primal Hunter*, *Arcane Ascension*).
- **The Path to Power**: Characters grow from competent adventurers to godlike entities.
- **Cultivation**: Power is earned through resource gathering, refinement, and breakthrough moments.
- **The System**: The world is governed by rigid, game-like laws that characters exploit and master.

## Design Philosophy

### Fast Play, Deep Planning
- **Session Flow**: Streamlined resolution for quick combat and skills.
- **Character Building**: Complex, rewarding choices for between-session engagement.

### Flexible Character Creation
- **Concept First**: Mechanics support character concepts, not define them.
- **No Class Restrictions**: Abilities can be mixed and matched.
- **Diverse Sources**: Magic, martial, psionics, and tech are equally supported.

### Mechanical Foundation
- **Consistency**: Reliable rules allow for strategy.
- **Balance**: No single build dominates; all choices are viable.
- **Structure**: Rules provide tactical depth, not narrative improv.

### Power Progression
- **Growth**: Clear power increases via skills, abilities, stats, and gear.
- **Milestones**: Satisfying advancement moments and tier breakthroughs.
- **Planning**: Long-term build strategies are rewarded.

### Tactical Depth
- **Positioning**: Terrain, range, and movement are decisive.
- **Scale**: Creature sizes (12mm to 250mm) have mechanical impact.
- **Strategy**: Planning and coordination outweigh luck.

### GM Ease
- **Prep**: Session setup is quick and modular.
- **Tools**: Mechanics support rapid encounter generation.

## Core Mechanical Decisions

### Action Economy
- **Action Tokens**: Characters use a pool of Action Tokens to pay for Universal and Character-Specific actions.
- **Reactions**: Reactions cost Action tokens, creating a tactical trade-off between offense and defense.

### Positioning
- **Forced Movement**: Push, Pull, and Reposition are core mechanics for battlefield control.
- **Size & Tier**: Physical scale and power level provide resistance to forced movement.

### Conditions
- **Negative Effects**: All conditions provide negative effects (no "buff" conditions; buffs are active effects).

## Core Tension
**Goal**: Limitless character flexibility within a balanced framework.

**Constraints**:
- No build is objectively superior.
- System remains teachable.
- Sessions maintain pace.
- All players remain effective.

## Rules for Writing Game Documents

### 1. Discuss First, Write After
Document decisions, not brainstorming. If a rule isn't final, put it in an "Open Questions" section at the bottom.

### 2. Writing Styles
- **Rules (Clinical)**: Clear, unambiguous, present tense, active voice. Tell the player *how to play*. No meta-commentary or design justification.
  - *Bad*: "We made reactions cost tokens to balance defense."
  - *Good*: "Reactions cost 1 Action Token."
- **Fluff (Conversational)**: Evocative, engaging, "travel guide to the multiverse" tone. Inspires imagination.
- **Actions (Tight)**: Strict format (see `action-style-guide.md`). Use abbreviations (Atk, Def, Dmg, B2B), implicit subjects for self-actions, and explicit labels for targets.

### 3. General Guidelines
- **No Meta-Commentary**: Omit design notes and comparisons to other games.
- **One Clear Example**: Provide one example per complex concept if needed.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Define a rule once, clearly. Use cross-references elsewhere.
- **Decided Rules Only**: The main text is for final decisions.
