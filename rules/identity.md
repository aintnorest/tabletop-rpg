# Identity

## Identity & Access
An **Identity** is a descriptive phrase representing a character's life experience, professional training, and social standing. Characters begin with **two** Identities at Tier 1.

### Thematic Access ("The Reason Why")
There are no skill lists. Characters cannot attempt tasks requiring specialized knowledge unless they possess a "Reason Why."

*   **Mundane Tasks**: Simple survival or basic conversation (Attemptable by anyone).
*   **Specialized Tasks**: Requires an **Identity**, **Archetype**, **Path**, or **Fragment** that logically justifies the knowledge or skill.
*   **Tier Lock**: Tasks are limited by complexity.
    *   **Max Attempt**: You can attempt tasks up to **one Tier higher** than your current Tier.
    *   **Impossible**: Tasks **two Tiers higher** are automatic failures.

## Evolution & Synthesis

### Identity Rank
Identities do not have separate ranks. An Identity's effectiveness is always equal to the **Character Tier**. As the soul expands, professional authority and social weight scale accordingly.

### Merging with the Path (Tier 3)
At Tier 3, a character may choose to **Synthesize** one Identity into their **Path Statement**, transforming past experience into a fundamental law of existence.

## Corruption & Identity Inversion

High Corruption fractures identity. For full Corruption rules and thresholds, see `stats.md`.

## Open Questions

- **Identity Synthesis Effect** (referenced in Merging with the Path section): What is the mechanical effect when an Identity is Synthesized into the Path Statement at Tier 3?
